# node-crawler
Web crawling with node-crawler (http://nodecrawler.org/).

I also used Webtask (https://webtask.io/), an Node module that runs serverless Javascript back-end codes.

To test, access the following url and replace the text {PAGE} with the desired page:
https://webtask.it.auth0.com/api/run/wt-6249c86710f2fba3d526eca802306e94-0/hacking?page={PAGE}
